# Women-Web-Dev-Basics @ISET Nabeul

Welcome to the Women-Web-Dev-Basics repository!

This repository contains materials for celebrating International Women's Day through web development basics. It includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript exercises to help you get started with web development.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git https://github.com/fadhlaouir/Women-Web-Dev-Basics.git
```

### 2. Open the Project

Open the project folder in your preferred code editor, such as Visual Studio Code.

### 3. Understanding the HTML Structure

`index.html`: This file represents the structure of our web page.

- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines the document type and ensures proper rendering in browsers.
- The `<html>` tag represents the root of the HTML document, with the `lang` attribute specifying the language.
- Inside the `<head>` section, we have metadata such as character encoding (`<meta charset="UTF-8">`) and viewport settings (`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`).
- The `<title>` tag sets the title of the webpage.
- External resources such as stylesheets (`<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`) and scripts (`<script src="script.js"></script>`) are linked.
- The `<body>` section contains the content of our webpage, including a header, main section, and a form.

### 4. Styling with CSS

`style.css`: This file contains the CSS styles to enhance the visual presentation of our webpage.

- Styles for `body`, `header`, `main`, `img`, `ul`, and `li` elements are defined.
- These styles include background colors, text alignment, padding, margin, list formatting, and image sizing.

### 5. Adding JavaScript Functionality

`script.js`: This file provides interactive functionality to our webpage.

- The `changeBackgroundColor()` function changes the background color of the webpage when triggered.
- Event listeners are added to the "Change Background Color" button (`changeColorBtn`) and the form submit button (`submitBtn`).
- Form validation ensures that the user fills in all required fields before submission.
- Image hover effect changes the image source when hovering over it.

### 6. Running the Project

Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the webpage. You can interact with the webpage by clicking the "Change Background Color" button, submitting the form, and hovering over the image.
